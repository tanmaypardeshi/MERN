# Basic MERN stack boilerplate

## Example of a basic MERN Stack Web App 

### Steps for downloading and installing the application : 

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/tanmaypardeshi/MERN.git`
2. Navigate to frontend folder and run `npm install` or `yarn` depending on your preference to install dependencies.
3. Navigate to backend folder and run `npm install` or `yarn` depending on your preference to install dependencies.
4. Create a local mongodb database and name it mern. Create a collection named "posts" in this database. If you prefer using
your mongo URI, you are free to do. Replace the MONGO_URI in [server.js](backend/server.js) in the backend folder 
5. To start backend server, navigate to backend folder and run `yarn start`.
6. To start frontend server, navigate to frontend folder and run `yarn start`.
7. Wait for both the servers to start and you can use the web app once the front end loads.
